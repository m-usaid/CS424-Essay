	abstract = {In the early 1920s, the German mathematician David Hilbert(1862–1943) put forward a new proposal for the foundation ofclassical mathematics which has come to be known as Hilbert’sProgram. It calls for a formalization of all of mathematics inaxiomatic form, together with a proof that this axiomatization ofmathematics is consistent. The consistency proof itself was to becarried out using only what Hilbert called “finitary”methods. The special epistemological character of finitary reasoningthen yields the required justification of classicalmathematics. Although Hilbert proposed his program in this form onlyin 1921, various facets of it are rooted in foundational work of hisgoing back until around 1900, when he first pointed out the necessityof giving a direct consistency proof of analysis. Work on the programprogressed significantly in the 1920s with contributions fromlogicians such as Paul Bernays, Wilhelm Ackermann, John von Neumann,and Jacques Herbrand. It was also a great influenceon Kurt Gödel, whose work on theincompleteness theorems were motivated by Hilbert’s Program.Gödel’s work is generally taken to show that Hilbert’s Programcannot be carried out. It has nevertheless continued to be aninfluential position in the philosophy of mathematics, and, startingwith the work of Gerhard Gentzen in the 1930s, work on so-calledRelativized Hilbert Programs have been central to thedevelopment of proof theory.},

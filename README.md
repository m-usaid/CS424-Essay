This is a short non-technical essay for the Joy of Theoretical Computer Science course
taught at Habib University. The essay initially focuses on the the abstraction of mathematical
theories and the structure of axiomatic systems. It then sheds light on 
the advent of set theory and the subsequent foundational crises in mathematics and
the different schools of recovery. 

The essay spends significant time on Formalism and David Hilbert's program, and 
its subsequent demise in the face of Kurt Godel's incompleteness theorems. 
Although this topic is closely related to pure mathematics, this also led to
the foundational questions of computability in theoretical computer science.
